Hey, my name is Jack. I am a first year computing undergraduate at Imperial College London. My favourite area of computing is databases. Before studying at Imperial, I studied at The Billericay School and Westcliff High School for Boys Sixth Form. I enjoy playing the piano, especially jazz and classical music.

I first realised I wanted to study computing when my A Level maths teacher started discussing computer-assisted proofs, and why some people didn't accept their validity. I was extremely intrigued, and so decided to complete my Extended Project on it. Since then, I have realised that computer science is a much wider area than just writing programs, and that is why I want to learn more about it.

In my free time, I enjoy listening to a wide variety of music, especially pop. When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time with my friends all over the country. I also love to travel  - my favourite experiences are surfing  in *Santa Barbara, California*, visiting museums in *Washington DC*, visiting the Colosseum in *Rome, Italy*, driving a Jeep across sand dunes in *Oman*, and visiting the world's tallest building in *Dubai, United Arab Emirates*.
